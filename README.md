# Obsidian-md Snippets

A collection of Obsidian-md `css` snippets that I've created. Anything that is dependent on a certain plugin or theme has the plugin/theme in it's file title.

## Included

- Dangling Link Text Color: makes the color of a dangling link the normal text color, rather than the whatever the currently active theme specifies. This is intended to be used with a smallcap link font, like can be found in `Typomagical`, but can also be used normally if you so prefer.
- Monospace: two plugins that make non content portions of the reader and editor monospaced to provide better visual differentiation. By default they use whatever monospace font is specified for the application.
  - Editor Gutter
  - Metadata
- Smooth Caret: Makes the editor caret move smoothly, like in VSCode (when the option is enabled) or in Microsoft Word. [Requires `Ninja Cursor`]
- Rendered Indentation Guide Fix: Adjusts the indentation guide in the reader to better align with the circular numbered style numbered style in `Typomagical`. [Requires `Typomagical`]
